S"Hi Qun,\nThanks for your email. Given that we are aiming to have this completed asap\nand given that we are not aiming to scale at this point (hence e.g. the\nchoice to stick with flask), could you build the app without a web\nframework, i.e. just using HTML/CSS/Javascript and Jinja templates (this is\nthe default template used by Flask)?\nThis is the set-up we currently use to build the app and there should be no\nlimitations in terms of page design by sticking with this set-up.\nI'm also wondering whether there's any way we could speed up the process.\nAm I right in remembering that this round of work was going to be conducted\nas a competition? Is there a way to just do this as a task instead, and ask\none person in the community to do it? I assume that would be quicker?\nI'd love to finalise this approach as soon as possible so looking forward\nto your response, thanks Qun,\nBec\n"
