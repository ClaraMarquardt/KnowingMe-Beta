S"To Whom It May Concern:\nClaremont McKenna College Career Services is hosting a Student Network Trek to Boston in March 2018.  I have been researching opportunities in the area, and the Harvard Laboratory for Systems Medicine presents a wonderful opportunity.\nFor your background, we have had several successful ventures to the Boston area, and we are looking forward to maintaining our track record.  The upcoming trip will focus around our Science/Medical Interest Clusters, specifically: Medicine, Biotech, Health Service, Science, and Environment.  Similar to previous trips, we anticipate a group of approximately 16-20 students and are open to any type of visit, including tours, presentations, and Q&A sessions.  Overall, the main goal is to provide the students with a better sense of the work of our host organizations, and increase their awareness of the vast number of career opportunities open to them, both now and in the future.\nAs one of the nation's most selective private liberal arts colleges, Claremont McKenna College (CMC) sits among the intellectually-stimulating, socially-fulfilling, seven-college community known as The Claremont Colleges, a system modeled after England's Oxford University. Founded in 1946, CMC is one of the youngest of the nation's top colleges and enrolls approximately 1,200 students.\nCMC educates its students for thoughtful and productive lives and responsible leadership in economics, government and public affairs. CMC's strong grounding in the liberal arts, together with its emphasis on economics, government, and international relations, attracts students who approach education pragmatically and who intend to make a difference in the world. With this broad-based foundation graduates leave CMC well prepared for the challenges of the 21st century. Many go on to pursue careers in law, business, government, foreign service, international relations, public policy, museum administration, science and education, or to pursue graduate study.\nWould it be possible to set up a phone conversation to discuss further?  Please let me know your availability, and we can schedule from there.\nThank you for considering this request, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.\nSincerely,\ngs\nGary Salata\nAssistant Director\nCareer Services @ The Soll Center for Student Opportunity\nClaremont McKenna College\nPhone: 909-607-8557\nFAX: 909-607-7385\n"
