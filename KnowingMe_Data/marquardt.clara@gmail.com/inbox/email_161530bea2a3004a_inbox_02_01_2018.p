Your Regional Manager now has the task of matching you with Alumni based in your preferred location. Once they have found a match they will reach out to you with the details via email.\nIt is important to remember that the matching process can take some time. Please be patient during this time.

You will get full instructions in the email on Monday and you will have until Monday 26 February to complete this part of the process.\nAs part of the video component, we will ask you to answer two video questions, one of which will be:\n1)      What will you gain from the London Business School MBA Programme that you won't gain from another MBA programme?\nNecessary Checks\nNext week we will be reaching out to the referees named in your application to conduct reference checks. These checks are a standard part of our admissions process.\nApril Welcome Weekend- Save the Date!\nAll Round 2 candidates who are offered a place on the MBA2020 programme will be invited to campus for London Business School's Welcome Weekend on Saturday 14 - Sunday 15 April.\nThis is the perfect opportunity to get a taste of campus life, explore the LBS MBA programme in great depth and begin forming friendships with your future classmates.
