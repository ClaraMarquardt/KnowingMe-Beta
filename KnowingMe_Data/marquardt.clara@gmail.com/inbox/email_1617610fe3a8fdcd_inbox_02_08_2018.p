S'Dear Clara,\nCongratulations once again on being selected to interview for the London Business School MBA2020 class!\nI have arranged for one of our alumni to interview you in Chicago.\nSetting up your interview:\nPlease contact your interviewer as soon as possible to organise a suitable time and place to meet. Lisa has let me know that she is traveling quite extensively over the next month, so if you could kindly be as flexible as possible in finding a time to meet, including the possibility of a weekend interview.\nDetails are below:\nName: Lisa Christensen\nEmail: lisachristensen214@gmail.com\nMBA Class: MBA2002\nYour interview needs to take place in time for the interviewer to send us their feedback by March 4th. Please be flexible in order to find a mutually convenient time. If you are unable to contact Lisa, or are unable to agree an interview time, please let me know immediately.\nOnce you have set a date and time to meet please complete this short form to update me with the details: http://forms.london.edu/form.asp?id=19506.\nThe interview:\n-       Remember to take with you and show Lisa a photo ID (driving licence, passport, national ID card etc.)\n-       You will give a short presentation (approx. 5 minutes) for which no prior preparation is required. You will receive the brief for this presentation in the interview.\n-       There is no need to take a copy of your application form or resume as I will send these to Lisa\n-       The interview is likely to last between 1 and 2 hours in total\nAfter the interview:\nLisa will provide the Admissions Committee with feedback, which they will consider along with the rest of your application.\nI would like to wish you the best of luck with your interview!\nKind regards,\nAlexandra\n'
