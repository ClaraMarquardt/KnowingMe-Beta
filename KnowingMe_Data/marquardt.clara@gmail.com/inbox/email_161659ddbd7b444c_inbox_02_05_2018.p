S'Hi all,\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s my yearly email summarising where I donated, 2017 edition. You may notice this one is a little late\xe2\x80\xa6 in fact most of these donations were made in early 2018 since I was slow this year.\nThe main purpose of this email remains to keep myself accountable, to friends rather than publicly. A bonus is sharing information about great nonprofits. Three of the four organisations I made relatively large donations to this year - ALLFED, Global Catastrophic Risk Institute, and the Web Integrity Project - are raising money right now, so donate away, or let me know if you\xe2\x80\x99d like to chat about them / be introduced to the people working on them.\nHeadlines\nMy donations were larger this year than they\xe2\x80\x99ve been before, which is exciting. That\xe2\x80\x99s my excuse for the inexcusable length of this email - more to say than usual.\nThey were ~2/3 focused on organisations related to global catastrophic risks and ~1/3 on bolstering U.S. political institutions - with some overlap since those two categories are related. This is a reversion to my 2014-15 donation tilt towards global catastrophic risks, after 2016 was mainly focused on US institutions post-election. So this year is a little \xe2\x80\x9czanier\xe2\x80\x9d.\nAnother change this year was I spent a lot of time working on an impact-motivated side project rather than just donating money. This was the Democracy Defense Fund <http://www.democracydefensefund.net/> (DDF), which I got started early last year - interesting experience; more details below.\nI set up a personal donor-advised fund <https://www.fidelitycharitable.org/philanthropy/what-is-a-donor-advised-fund.shtml> this year and gave money to it. For my own internal accounting (as well as for tax accounting), this is how I consider living up to my Giving What We Can 10% pledge <https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/> this year.\nAll donations below, other than to DDF, came from my donor-advised fund.\nThis email is mostly donation-focused without the usual income/expenditure focus, since I can\xe2\x80\x99t share some details of my income this year. I\xe2\x80\x99ll likely be back to my regularly scheduled oversharing next year, so if you\xe2\x80\x99re worried I\xe2\x80\x99m erecting sensible human boundaries, have no fear.\nMy approach to donations is about the same as it has been for the last few years: I think I can have the largest impact by donating to new organisations/projects, working in high impact areas, where I have some special information. I summarised this donation strategy in this post <http://effective-altruism.com/ea/16b/why_i_donated_to_the_environmental_data/> last year.\nHow did my 2016 donations turn out?\nMy biggest donation in 2016 was $3,000 to the Environmental Data & Governance Initiative, which I wrote about in some depth here <http://effective-altruism.com/ea/16b/why_i_donated_to_the_environmental_data/>. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t reviewed the donation carefully, but from what I have looked at I feel pretty great about it. EDGI seems to have been highly productive over the last year, with little funding. Their work on website monitoring has been thorough, and has regularly been used by major news outlets <https://envirodatagov.org/press/#coverage>, sometimes in ways that led to political action. E.g. one NYT piece <https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/20/climate/epa-climate-change.html> covering EDGI\xe2\x80\x99s work on climate change information being removed from EPA websites led to a letter from 7 Democratic senators <https://envirodatagov.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Letter-from-7-Dem-Senators-to-EPA-171114.pdf>7 Democratic senators <https://envirodatagov.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Letter-from-7-Dem-Senators-to-EPA-171114.pdf> to Scott Pruitt (EPA administrator), and EDGI continued to brief Senate staffers for Pruitt\xe2\x80\x99s hearing this January. Additionally, people outside of politics (in my bubble at least) ended up caring a lot about relatively \xe2\x80\x9cboring\xe2\x80\x9d changes to e.g. the EPA website this year, largely because of groups like EDGI.\nOne way EDGI has had less impact than it might have done had the Trump administration been even worse, is that (to my knowledge) the EPA hasn\xe2\x80\x99t deleted climate datasets yet, just changed information on websites and made some data harder to find. Perhaps the scrutiny from EDGI and others on Pruitt\xe2\x80\x99s EPA has had something to do with this, or perhaps it was unlikely all along that datasets would be deleted in 2017. In any case, this is happy news for the world.\n2017 Larger donations\nALLFED <http://allfed.info/>: $10,000\nALLFED is a research organisation working on how to avoid mass starvations if there is industrial collapse or a significant loss in our ability to produce food, e.g. due to nuclear winter blocking out the sun (or, less likely, asteroids or supervolcanic eruptions). Unfortunately, given the probability of nuclear war, this is worth investigating. The founder, David Denkenberger, has motivated just how important the problem is in this post <http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1hq/how_you_can_save_expected_lives_for_020400_each/>.\nThis is not an area I am closely familiar with, but David has impressed me a lot from afar as having striking intellectual originality. He hit upon an important area receiving relatively little attention, and pursed the idea in his academic research for years based on logical arguments without many accolades or funding (ALLFED is largely self-funded to date), publishing lots of interesting papers <http://allfed.info/papers/> in the meantime.\nThe reason I haven\xe2\x80\x99t donated more is I don\xe2\x80\x99t know David or the rest of the team well (we spoke on Skype once before this donation, and exchanged a couple emails three years ago). To make a larger donation I feel like I would need more context on the team and the problem.\nA minor final comment: I think there is some moral hazard with this donation that makes me uncomfortable: the better prepared we are for nuclear winter, the more likely people fire nuclear weapons, as silly as that sounds. And I hope the world in total invests much more in preventative measures than in cleanup measures.\nGlobal Catastrophic Risk Institute <http://gcrinstitute.org/> (GCRI): $10,000\nSeth Baum, the Executive Director of GCRI, is at this point an original gangster in the field of Global Catastrophic Risks, and has a productive publishing record <http://gcrinstitute.org/publications/> on topics I think are important. GCRI has a funding gap this year, and lots of the projects they\xe2\x80\x99re working on look promising to me - mainly related to understanding risks from transformational artificial intelligence. \nGCRI comes off well compared to other donation opportunities within the field of AI safety from Ben Hoskin\xe2\x80\x99s investigations/summary <http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1iu/2018_ai_safety_literature_review_and_charity/>, which I found useful to read.\nFor anyone on this thread not familiar with why risks from developing AI are worth investigating, here are some addictive explanatory blog posts from Wait But Why - part 1 <https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html> about AI progress and part 2 <https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-2.html> about risks.\nDemocracy Defense Fund <http://www.democracydefensefund.net/> (DDF): $5,090.60\nAfter the election I was one of many people worried about threats to U.S. democratic institutions (courts, free press, voting laws). I started DDF as a side project with my then-boyfriend Ethan Barhydt, to match up people who wanted to donate to protect U.S. institutions with domain experts who could investigate where the best places to donate were. DDF had two fund managers, Professor Barbara Fried <https://law.stanford.edu/directory/barbara-fried/>Barbara Fried <https://law.stanford.edu/directory/barbara-fried/> who ran the Democratic Participation Fund, and Nikita Lalwani <https://www.linkedin.com/in/nlalwani/> who ran the Free Press Fund. They were helped by three researchers, who sourced and vetted potential grantee organisations: Connor Flexman, Alasdair Phillips-Robins, and Chris Peak. I fundraised (including $5,090.60 from myself - tough pitch) and helped coordinate things / administer the grants.\nWe ran a \xe2\x80\x9cpilot\xe2\x80\x9d of $40,000 of grants, with the idea of testing out a grant-making process to see if we could find great things to fund before scaling up further. The two fund managers wrote comprehensive reports on the grants we made here: Repairers of the Breach, and Forward Justice <https://medium.com/democracy-defense-fund/grants-to-repairers-of-the-breach-and-forward-justice-8d23b77e7f09> and Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press <https://medium.com/democracy-defense-fund/grant-to-reporters-committee-for-freedom-of-the-press-d050c7871ad3>.\nI found the work rewarding, and think there were positive signs from the pilot. Unfortunately I didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like I had enough time to scale DDF up as a proper institution alongside my day job, and other members of the team were all volunteering alongside full-time jobs/school as well, so DDF is now dormant and we\xe2\x80\x99re not accepting donations. We analysed our pilot grant-making in some depth, so if you\xe2\x80\x99re interested let me know and I can forward some summary emails.\nWeb Integrity Project <https://sunlightfoundation.com/2018/02/02/why-were-launching-the-web-integrity-project/>, Sunlight Foundation: $5,000\nThe Web Integrity Project is a new organisation (officially launched on Friday!) that\xe2\x80\x99s part of the Sunlight Foundation, focused on monitoring changes made to U.S. government websites.\nThis is an expansion of the work my friends Andrew Bergman/Toly Rinberg did last year at EDGI. Background: After Andrew recommended EDGI as a donation opportunity to me, he and his friend/lab-mate Toly ended up taking a leave of absence from their PhDs to volunteer full-time at EDGI. During that period they also became fellows at the Sunlight Foundation, a nonprofit focused on government transparency. Now Toly, Andrew, and a third team member Rachel Bergman are starting a project within the Sunlight Foundation expanding their work on monitoring government websites from climate/environment to other parts of government, starting with health.\nI trust Andrew a lot in selecting important things to focus on that other people aren\xe2\x80\x99t focused on. I am also impressed with the work he and Toly have done over the last year at EDGI and on their own, and think they have a system they can scale successfully beyond the climate domain.\nThey have some internal funding to get started, but I believe I am the first external funder. I think having an external donor will make them more focused/accountable/ambitious.\nI am not donating more than $5,000 as I am not sure the new areas of government they\xe2\x80\x99re taking on are as important as environment/science, which have clearer long term global effects. As such it\xe2\x80\x99s not an \xe2\x80\x9cobvious\xe2\x80\x9d donation area for me, given the ways I usually look at things, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not overcommitting to it.\n2017 Smaller donations - $100 each\nGiveWell <https://www.givewell.org/> (unrestricted use, likely operational expenses)\nAgainst Malaria Foundation <https://www.againstmalaria.com/>\nNuclear Threat Initiative <http://www.nti.org/> (4th year running)\nPloughshares Fund <https://www.ploughshares.org/> (4th year running)\nJohns Hopkins Center for Health Security, following Jaime Yassif\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation <https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/suggestions-individual-donors-open-philanthropy-project-staff-2017#Johns_Hopkins_Center_for_Health_Security>\nCompassion in World Farming, following Lewis Bollard\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation <https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/suggestions-individual-donors-open-philanthropy-project-staff-2017#Compassion_in_World_Farming_USA>\nTotal donations: $30,690.60\nMiscellaneous comments\nLast year I mused about how much I was spending and wrote \xe2\x80\x9cThe balancing act I\xe2\x80\x99ve landed on for 2017 is to try and keep my expenditure constant from 2016 [= $35.6k]\xe2\x80\x9d. I failed at this - my best estimate is I spent $41k in 2017. Given the other context of my year, I think this made sense and I\xe2\x80\x99m fine with it, though I\xe2\x80\x99m embarrassed I missed the goal. My expenditure will likely go up more in 2018 as I just moved to a more expensive apartment and don\xe2\x80\x99t plan to change my other spending habits.\nBook recommendations from 2017: Close Range <https://www.amazon.com/Close-Range-Wyoming-Annie-Proulx/dp/0684852225/> by Annie Proulx, and Anathem <https://www.amazon.com/Anathem-Neal-Stephenson/dp/006147410X/> by Neal Stephenson though it\xe2\x80\x99s obnoxiously long.\nOnwards,\nJacob\n'
