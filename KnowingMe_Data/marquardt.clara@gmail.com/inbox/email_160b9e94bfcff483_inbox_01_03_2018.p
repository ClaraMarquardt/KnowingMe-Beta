S'How about this --\nAs I collaborated with dozens of stake-holders in creating camera shots to\nportray life at the invisible last mile, I was exposed to diverging\nopinions on what had started out as a one-dimensional problem on paper. For\nexample, in order to educate the village youth, donations had been\nearmarked towards building a school. However, when the chaos of consulting\nteachers and students, village elders and party officials, and donors and\npolicy expert subsided, we came together in concluding that in fact,\nallocating those funds to create a bus route to the neighboring village\nwith a thriving primary school education was in fact most cost effective.\nIt was in this process that I discovered not just a novel solution to the\nproblem, but what to me, a young foreigner in rural China, was a novel\napproach to problem solving -- I began to see that complex social problems\nwere best addressed by ideas that balanced divergent perspectives.\n'
