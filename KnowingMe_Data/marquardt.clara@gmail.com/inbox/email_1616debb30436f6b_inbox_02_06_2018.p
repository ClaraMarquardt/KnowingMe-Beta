S"Hi Clara,\nWanted to get your thoughts since what we decide will determine what we get\nback from Topcoder: Qun's earlier comment was:\n*I think at this point there are two options within the current budget:*\n*Build the prototype with the current screens*\n*Or build the backend services based on the current screens*\n*\xe2\x80\x8b*\n*Both depend on the current screens, both are necessary and useful for your\nteam to take and build from.**\xe2\x80\x8b*\n*If the changes will affect the workflow of the app, then neither is a good\noption.*\n*If the changes are mostly about the texts and not the workflow of the app,\nthen either would make sense.*\nGiven this and his other comment (below), do you have a view about what we\nshould push to get back from Topcoder, given we'll still want to make a lot\nof changes? I'm trying to get a sense for how much of the work will need to\nbe redone once we get the deliverables back (and therefore what's worth\ndoing with the current frames versus not worth doing).\n-Bec\n"
