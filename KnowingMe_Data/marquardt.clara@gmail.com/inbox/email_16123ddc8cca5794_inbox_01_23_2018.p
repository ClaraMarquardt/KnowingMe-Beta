S'\nMarquardt,Clara Sophie\nDear Clara\nFurther to the email from Jeremy Caddick in November, in which you were invited to graduate to the MA at the congregation on 24th February 2018, I am writing to remind you to book your place at the ceremony by Friday 26th January 2018.\nIf you wish to take your MA on this occasion (either in person or in absence), please complete the form on the College website (http://www.emma.cam.ac.uk/life/graduation/ma/).  To do this you will need either an active Raven account or to have registered as an Old Member (which you can do easily on the website).  The College does not make a charge for handling the applications.   If you have any questions or difficulties please contact the Tutorial Office tutorial-office@emma.cam.ac.uk<mailto:tutorial-office@emma.cam.ac.uk> as soon as possible.\nWe look forward to welcoming you in February.\nBest wishes\nHelen Waterson\nTutorial and Admissions Administrator\nEmmanuel College\n'
