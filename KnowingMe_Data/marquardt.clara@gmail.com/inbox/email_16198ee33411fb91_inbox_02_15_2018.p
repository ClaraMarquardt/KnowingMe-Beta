S"Clara,\nhappy to help. That's the fantastic part about LBS, people are willing to help out where they can. And once you are here, you can pay it forward \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a, that's how it works.\nGood luck with your interview and please do keep me posted. If something comes up just before, don't hesitate to ask, I'd be happy to help where I can!\nP.S. - LBS Hackathon is also a big event for aspiring entrepreneurs - so have a look at that (it took place this past weekend). Something worth mentioning...The person to follow on twitter for Tech and Start-ups as it pertains to LBS' career service, is David Morris - he helps students land jobs in start-ups or kick off their own ventures.\nCheers,\nChristoph\n"
