S'Dear Clara,\nI would like to congratulate you once again on being selected for an interview!\nAs the Recruitment and Admissions Manager responsible for candidates based in the US and Canada, I am your point of contact. I look forward to getting to know you and guiding you throughout this process. If you have questions at any time, please do not hesitate to reach out.\n[cid:image001.jpg@01D39C43.3895A730]<https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1Rf2wQlj8IKSDRsUjQtNHpkdUk/view?usp=sharing>\nPlease click on the image above for a short introduction.\nYour next steps:\n1.       I will work to match you with a member of our alumni community for an in person interview as soon as possible. I will endeavour to match you with an alumnus in your preferred location.\nYou have indicated that you would like to be interviewed in the following location: Chicago\nIf your interview preference has changed, please contact me immediately with your preferred location. If you are traveling extensively during this period, detail your travel schedule.\nInterviews must take place in time for Interview Feedback to be submitted by Sunday, 4 March.\nPlease be patient, as the matching process takes time!\nOnce matched with an MBA alumnus, I will forward their contact details to you. You will contact your interviewer directly and work with them to arrange a mutually convenient time.  Please be flexible in arranging this time.\n2.       You should have already seen the note in your decision email from my colleague Alessandra Gazzola introducing the video component of your application. You will receive further instructions from her via email on Monday. Please be sure to read this carefully!\nSave the date:\nAll Round 2 candidates who are offered a place on the MBA2020 programme will be invited to join us at London Business School for our Welcome Weekend. This will take place Saturday, 14th - Sunday, 15th April and will be a great opportunity to get to know the School and meet potential future classmates!\nAgain, please feel free to contact me if you have any questions. I look forward to working with you!\nWith kind regards,\nAlexandra\n'
