S'Clara Marquardt\nDear Clara,\nAs you know, once you are a member of the College, you are invited back every few years with your Emma contemporaries. The first of these occurs when you become eligible to receive your MA degree, which will happen imminently. You may proceed to your MA, provided you have a BA degree, once six years have elapsed after your first term of residence. The first opportunity to take your MA in person will be on Saturday 24 February 2018. We would be delighted to welcome you back to the College for the occasion.\nThe day before the ceremony, Friday 23 February, all graduands are invited to dinner. Drinks will be served at 7pm in the Old Library followed by dinner in Hall at 7.30pm. Dress code is lounge suits for men and something equivalent for women. Gowns are not required. I am afraid that we will not have room to accommodate guests.\nThe next day we will assemble in the Old Library, dressed for the occasion, at about 2 pm (the exact time will be fixed about a week beforehand, when we know what time we are due at the Senate House). After a brief rehearsal we will process to the Senate House for the ceremony. It is likely that the person presiding will be the Master, Dame Fiona Reynolds.\nAs for your BA graduation ceremony, guests are admitted to the Senate House by ticket only. There up to two tickets available per graduand.\nAfter the ceremony you and your guests are warmly invited to afternoon tea in the College, either in the Old Library or the Upper Hall, from 4pm to 6pm. Please note that you will have to make your own arrangements for lunch on the Saturday.\nIf you wish to graduate to the MA on this occasion (either in person or in absence), please complete the form on the College website (http://www.emma.cam.ac.uk/life/graduation/ma/). To do this you will need either an active Raven account or to have registered as an Old Member (which you can do easily on the website). Please do this by Friday 26 January 2018 as we cannot add late applicants to the University lists of those proceeding to the degree. The College does not make a charge for handling the applications. If you have any questions or difficulties please contact Helen Waterson (tutorial-office@emma.cam.ac.uk<mailto:tutorial-office@emma.cam.ac.uk>).\nWhat you need to wear for the ceremony is described on the College website (http://www.emma.cam.ac.uk/life/graduation/ma/dresscode/). Please take care to turn up correctly dressed. The eagle-eyed Proctors and staff at the Senate House check for infringements.\nAs the ceremony takes place during term time, overnight accommodation will be very limited. Some (fairly basic) College guestrooms are available on a first come first served basis. Please e mail guestrooms@emma.cam.ac.uk<mailto:guestrooms@emma.cam.ac.uk> if you would like to enquire about these.\nI hope that you will continue to keep in touch with Emmanuel and visit us regularly.  You can let us know of any changes to your contact details or your current job through the College website http://www.emma.cam.ac.uk/members/keepintouch/ or by emailing the Development Office development-office@emma.cam.ac.uk<mailto:development-office@emma.cam.ac.uk>. Once you have received your MA you will be invited in March or April the following year to dine at High Table with the Master, Senior Tutor and Development Director.  Thereafter, you may dine at High Table up to twice a year at College expense and bring a guest (for whom there is a charge). You may do this either individually or in groups. There are more details at www.emma.cam.ac.uk/dining<http://www.emma.cam.ac.uk/dining>.\nLooking further into the future, you will be invited to spend a weekend in the College for a Members Gathering every 7 to 10 years.  The first time your year group will be invited will be in 2025.  Do please come: you are always warmly welcome.\nI very much hope that you will be able to attend and I look forward to seeing you in February!\nWith best wishes,\nJeremy Caddick\nPraelector\n'
