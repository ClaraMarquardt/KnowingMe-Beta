S"Hi Cameron,\nGreat to talk to you the other week. I've had a chat with the team now and\nidentified a couple of pieces of work on the gender bias app that I think\nyou'll find interesting and engaging.\nI'm cc'ing Clara here - if you can find time to have a call with Clara that\nwould be great. Clara is in Germany this week, so I think it'll be too hard\nto find a time for the 3 of us to connect, but Clara and I have talked\nthrough where we think you can plug in and she's the best person to get you\nup to speed.\nBroadly, I think that there's a really interesting piece of work for you to\nsink your teeth into around the question motif insight (you would have seen\nsome papers on that topic in the folder I shared - dive into those if you\nhaven't yet). There's also an integral backend piece focused on getting\nfrom the email data pull to having the data ready to be analysed by the NLP\nmachine that Clara and Jeff have been building.\nClara will talk you through more detail, and I'd love to have another call\nwith you after that before you get started. I'm not sure what your schedule\nis like this week but if you have time to have a call with Clara before\nThanksgiving, that'll really help us keep up the momentum.\nCheers Cameron, and happy Thanksgiving!\nBec\n"
