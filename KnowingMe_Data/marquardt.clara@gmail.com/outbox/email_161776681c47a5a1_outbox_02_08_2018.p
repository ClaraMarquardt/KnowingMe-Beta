S'Hi, \nJust an update on my current time plan as I am not sure whether you are still planning on checking in at any point. \nUnless you let me know otherwise, I will plan on committing the next two weeks fully to KnowingMe (I will communicate this to Jens). By the 26th we can reassess where we are, i.e. if everything looks to be back on track or whether we will need the time remaining until testing. \nBelow two key points that put this into context:\nTopcoder output has fallen far short of what we had agreed upon, and there will hence be significantly more work on my end than anticipated as well as the need to leave time to account for any surprises regarding the output that we do get back from them. \nEvening/weekends are continuing to be taken up by application-related work on my end - video essays, more written essays, interviews, etc.\nLet me know if you have any concerns about this plan, \nClara\n'
