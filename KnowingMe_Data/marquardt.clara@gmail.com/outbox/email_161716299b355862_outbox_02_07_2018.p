S'Hi Ziad, \nCc\xe2\x80\x99ed Xiaolin and Zach, both Ph.D. students at Harvard\xe2\x80\x99s Sociology Department. They spoke to Sendhil a few weeks ago and discussed the possibility of doing work with the team. Sendhil had asked them to follow up, but they have had some difficulty getting in touch with him - through Eric their email landed now with me. \nPutting you all in touch directly so that you can discuss any next steps. \nMany thanks,\nClara'
