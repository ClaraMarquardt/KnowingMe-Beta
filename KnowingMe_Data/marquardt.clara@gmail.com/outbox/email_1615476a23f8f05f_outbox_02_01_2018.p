S"Hi, \n \nJust wanted to send you a heads-up about a call you may receive from LBS and, most importantly, some positive news. I just heard back from LBS \xe2\x80\x93 another interview invite a week after I heard back from Booth (Sloan gets back to applicants at the end of the month)! A huge thank you again for your references and support which helped me get this far!\n \nLBS has informed all applicants that they will be doing 'reference checks' next week \xe2\x80\x93 from what I gather this means that you will receive an email or phone call to verify that you did indeed write the reference. Hopefully it should be super quick either way!\n \nMany thanks again, \nClara"
