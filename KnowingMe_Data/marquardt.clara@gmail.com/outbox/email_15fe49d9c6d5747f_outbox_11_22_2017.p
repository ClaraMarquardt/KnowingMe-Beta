S'\nhttps://www.trendfrenzy.net/chicken-travel-world/ <https://www.trendfrenzy.net/chicken-travel-world/>\n24-year-old Guirec Soud\xc3\xa9e from Brittany, France took a chicken named Monique on a 39ft boat with him on his trip around the world thinking she would be a good source of food (eggs, he meant eggs) but she soon proved to be much more than that \xe2\x80\x93 now she is the best companion he could ever have! Not only does she lay about 6 eggs a week, she also surfs and swims, catches flying fish that lands on deck or even skateboards (when on the ground) with Soud\xc3\xa9e.\r'
