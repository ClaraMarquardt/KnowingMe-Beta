S'Hi Bec, \nThanks for forwarding. This is not ideal especially given the last minute timing, but I think that the best solution may be to have them finish the current app so that we have something to work with? \nThe mock-ups themselves (the output of the design phase) are of little help. \nI think that overall, given that we are not yet at a stage where we have tied down any piece of the app, it would be best for us to own the development process. My sense is that Topcoder could become a useful resource again once we have a final user journey. I will speak to Sendhil in the coming days to see if I can commit more time in the next few weeks to account for this. \nTwo things that were not clear to me (these may be things you discussed with them in the past):  (a) The difference between \xe2\x80\x98prototype\xe2\x80\x99 and the \xe2\x80\x98backend services\xe2\x80\x99 and (b) Whether you mentioned to them that we need the the app to be built in flask (Qun referred to Angular.js in his note). \nI think we should aim to have them confirm asap (a) what exactly the deliverable will be, e.g. a folder with python scripts that constitute a flask app and (b) a promised delivery date. \nClara\n'
