S'\n1. OK for me to take 1 day per week (Mon-Fri) to work on KnowingMe (in addition to evenings, weekends\xe2\x80\xa6) to get us ready for March?\nI have had some trouble the past month finding the right balance between work on the paper,  other urban labs projects, KnowingMe and my applications/interviews. With the ideas42 testing session approaching, I am starting to think that I will need to spend more time during the week (in addition to evenings, mornings and weekends - time which continues to be consumed partly by my applications) on KnowingMe to get us back on track.\nBefore I talk to Jens about this, I wanted to check with you whether dedicating, e.g. one day per week for KnowingMe until March, seems reasonable (I remember you mentioning that I should reach out if I felt like we needed to rethink the balance between KnowingMe and Jens work ). \n2. OK for me to come to NYC for the testing week in March?\nBec had asked if I would be able to come up to NYC for the testing week in March. I think it would be super helpful to have a full week to make a big push on KnowingMe. As above - wanted to get your feedback before discussing with Jens.\nAnd of course, Happy New Year!\n'
