S'Hi Ariel, \nI just wanted to send you a quick note to say a huge thank you for the interview earlier today! It was incredible to have an opportunity to share my passion for data-driven social innovation and entrepreneurship, and I appreciated the effort you made to make the interview so much less stressful!\nLearning about your background and goals convinced me yet again that Booth is the place I could find people who shared my passion for innovative ideas and a community which would support me as I seek to scale the scope of my impact - thank you!\nMany thanks once more, \nClara\n'
