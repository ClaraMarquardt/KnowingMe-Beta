S"\nClara Marquardt sent the following message at 12:26 PM\nApplying to Sloan with an interest in entrepreneurship, technology, and design-thinking\nHi Lisa,  I am currently in the process of applying to the MBA program at Sloan and came across your LinkedIn Profile as I was searching for Alumni who had gone on to work at IDEO. I was inspired by the projects that you worked on at Sloan as well as your position since graduating. Experiences which reflect a lot of the things that I am passionate about: design-thinking, entrepreneurship, emerging tech and social impact.  While I am super excited by Sloan' curriculum and faculty, I am trying to get a better sense of how I could best develop my interest, in design-thinking in particular, while at Sloan. In this spirit, I was wondering if you would have time for a quick chat at any point in the coming weeks.   My background very briefly -  Having grown up in China (where I moved from Germany), I started out with a keen interest in data-driven and evidence-based public policy. Relocating to the US, I saw my thinking about how to best realize these interests evolve as I founded and scaled a tech start-up in San Francisco and spent two years working with an early-stage company in Boston leveraging data science and machine learning to tackle pressing social challenges in the healthcare and education space. Looking ahead, I am hoping to obtain an MBA to help me combine my interests in data science and entrepreneurship to tackle social problems at scale.  I look forward to hearing back from you!  Many thanks and best wishes for the year ahead, Clara"
