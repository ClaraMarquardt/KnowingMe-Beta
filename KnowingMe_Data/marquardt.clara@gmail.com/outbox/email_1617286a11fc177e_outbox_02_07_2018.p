S'Hi Alex, \nThank you so much for helping us test the set-up of the app (and to the whole Ideas42 team for working with us)!\nThe error that you are encountering is not an error that I have faced before, but I have a hypothesis as to what may be happening. The goods news is that the app is still in beta testing - in a month we will hopefully have all these issues ironed out!\nIf you have a few minutes at any point in the coming days for a super quick call that would be helpful - both to help us isolate the problem and to quickly confirm that all the other critical pieces of the pipeline are still working as expected. \nMany thanks, \nClara\n'
