     <br>

     <br><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='image/icon/idea.png') }}" style="width:22px;height:20px;"/>&nbsp;<b>Positivity Imbalance</b><br>The ratio between the positivity of the emails you sent and the positivity of the emails you responded to. A positivity imbalance greater than 1 shows that you're more 'positive' to others than they are to you.
