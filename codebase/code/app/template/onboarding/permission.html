    <p style="text-align:center; padding-left:350px; padding-right:350px;"><font color="#464241"> We want to help you understand how you communicate.<br><br>To do this, we (i) collect your email address and gather some basic information from your Gmail Profile (full name + profile photo) and (ii) pull the text and metadata of your sent and received emails over a specified period from your Gmail account. Whether you are using the Desktop or Web app, we are committed to safeguarding the data we collect.


    <br><br><img src="{{url_for('static', filename='image/icon/desktop.png')}}" style="width:55px;height:55px;"/><br><b>Desktop App</b><br>All the data that we collect is stored and analyzed locally on your computer. <br>No data is collected, analyzed or retained by us in any other location.

    <br><br><img src="{{url_for('static', filename='image/icon/cloud.png')}}" style="width:50px;height:50px;"/><br><b>Web App</b><br>All the data that we collect is stored and analyzed on a web server hosted by Amazon Web Servers (AWS). No data is collected, analyzed or retained by us in any other location. The data is secured with a user-session-specific password and accessible only to our team's CTO. Any data that is transferred to the server is automatically deleted within 24 hours as part of a daily server reboot. 

    <br><br>

    In either case you can delete all your data by following these steps to properly terminate the app: (i) Log out of the app, confirming your intent to reset the app when prompted; (ii) Close this browser window; (iii) (Desktop App Only) Terminate the Docker container in which the app is being executed; and (iv) (Desktop App Only) Delete the user-designated data folder.
