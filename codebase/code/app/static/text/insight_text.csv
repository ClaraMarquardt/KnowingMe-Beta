screen_1,talkative,"We'll analyze your sent and received emails. First, we'll strip out all the bits of your email that aren't text written by the sender - e.g. recipient email addresses and earlier emails in the chain. Then, we'll measure the length of that email text in a few different ways, so you can see how you communicate with different groups."

screen_intro,responsiveness,"How often do you send an email but get no response? Maybe you're a chronic non-responder yourself? Are there lots of unreplied emails lurking in your inbox? Ever wondered if you get more replies from men or women? Or if you reply more to women or men? Let's launch our responsiveness analysis and see what we can find out!"
screen_1,responsiveness,"We're analyzing your sent and received emails. For your sent emails, we'll check whether you received a reply.For emails you received, we'll check if you replied. We'll also measure the time between the initial email and the reply."
screen_intro,sentiment,"When you read an email, you can tell whether the tone or 'sentiment' of the email is positive or negative, right?Our analytical machine can assess the sentiment of your sent and received emails. We can see whether you're more positive now than you were in the past, whether the emails you send are more positive than the ones you receive, and even whether you're more positive to one gender than another. So let's take a look, shall we?"
screen_1,sentiment,"Sentiment' refers to how positive or negative certain text is. We humans are pretty good at determining whether a piece of text is positive or negative, but we often couldn't describe exactly how we do it. Our analytical engine does it by taking the text of an email and applying a series of rules to determine a 'sentiment score' with 1 being extremely positive and 0 being extremely negative. The rules are testing both the direction of the sentiment (e.g. are there positive or negative words?) as well as the intensity of the sentiment (e.g. are there really positive or really negative words?). Click ahead to see some examples of how this analysis plays out."
screen_2,sentiment,"Click on the buttons below to see how our sentiment analysis tool would score each of the following sentences. At the bottom, you can even type in your own text to test!"
screen_add,sentiment,"Our sentiment analysis uses a rule-based sentiment analysis tool called VADER: Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner. This implements the grammatical and syntactical rules described in the paper ""VADER: A Parsimonious Rule-based Model for Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Text"" by C.J. Hutto and Eric Gilbert. It incorporates empirically derived quantifications for the impact of each rule on the perceived intensity of sentiment in sentence-level text. Importantly, these heuristics go beyond what would normally be captured in a typical bag-of-words model by e.g. incorporating word-order sensitive relationships between terms. Degree modifiers (also called intensifiers, booster words, or degree adverbs) for example impact sentiment intensity by either increasing or decreasing the intensity."
screen_intro,politeness,"Have you received an email that seemed a little rude? Maybe no single word or sentence seemed rude, but somehow it just felt a little curt or impolite? You might have detected some subtle language cues. World-leading academics have used computer science processing power to analyze tons of text and work out what these subtle cues are. We're going to apply that powerful analysis to your emails, and show you where you - and the people who email you - are more and less polite."
screen_1,politeness,"Our analytical engine scans your emails looking for 'requests' - text where you asked someone to do something, or someone else asked you to do something. Then our algorithm looks for certain indicators of politeness or impoliteness. These are the subtle cues that academics have worked out are predictive of whether you're polite or not. Requests that include caveats, such as, 'If you're not too busy, would you mind sending that email to' for example are deemed more polite than blunt requests, such as, 'Please send that email first thing tomorrow'."
screen_2,politeness,"Let's have a look at some of the things our analysis will pick up, by looking at how each of the requests below would be scored by our analysis engine. You can even type in a request of your own and see how polite our algorithm thinks it is!"
screen_add,politeness,"Our analytical engine combs your emails looking for ""requests"" - sentences where someone has asked something of you, or vice versa. We analyze each request and give it a score on the politeness scale, which runs from 0 (being the least polite) to 1 (being the most polite). If an email contains more than one request, we'll analyze all the politeness of each of the requests, and score the politeness of that email based on the least polite request - the idea being that you'd probably consider an email rude even if it was rude only once. With huge thanks to Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, Moritz Sudhof, Dan Jurafsky, Jure Leskovec, and Christopher Potts, on whose work we heavily rely. You can check out their paper on the topic, ""A computational approach to politeness with application to social factors"". "
screen_intro,coordination,"When we communicate with each other, we're often conveying a lot more what we consciously intend. When you talk to someone in person, you're conveying meaning and emotion through tone, body language, and facial expressions.You might also be - unknowingly - coordinating the style of your language with that of your conversation partner. (There are lots of reasons why you might do this, and we'll explain them later on.)In this section, we're going to analyze how much you engage in this kind of coordination in emails, and whether you coordinate differently with men versus women."
screen_1,coordination,"This one's a little complex, so let's try an example.If I said: ""At what time does the train depart?""...and you replied: ""At 8 pm.""...you coordinated your response with my question. When we talk about this kind of coordination - linguistic style coordination - we're not talking about using the exact same vocabulary as someone else, but using the same kind of structural elements of a sentence. We're talking about our use of articles, conjunctions, personal pronouns, for example.We coordinate our linguistic style with people we view as more powerful than us - it could be a boss who has the power to promote us or someone in our friendship group who we view as having more social cachet with the group.Click on to dive into some examples that will illustrate this concept."
screen_2,coordination,Let's take a look at some sample questions and responses to learn more about what linguistic style coordination is.
screen_add,coordination,"Our analysis is powered by the work of leading academics including Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, Lillian Lee, Bo Pang and Jon Kleinberg. We measure your linguistic style by looking at your usage of categories of function words that have little semantic meaning - these are words that mark style rather than content. We're looking specifically at eight linguistic markers that humans deploy in a non-conscious way. These are: Articles, auxiliary verbs, conjunctions, high-frequency adverbs, impersonal pronouns, personal pronouns, prepositions, and quantifiers.We look first at your ""baseline"" communication style: across all your sent emails, what's your average usage of these function words? Then, we look for emails where you're responding to someone else. Let's say the person who emailed you used a lot of articles. Given your ""baseline"" communication style, we can predict on average how many articles you'll use. So we look to see if you're using more or fewer articles in your response. Undertaking that analysis across these eight linguistic markers gives us a measure of how much you're coordinating with the recipient.A couple of other things: we're only analyzing the first five sentences of your response - the academic work in this space suggests that coordination would decrease further into a long email, so the first bit should have the most signal. We're also only looking at your responses where you responded to at least two emails from this sender - that's because we need something of a baseline to make a comparison. You might also note that we're not showing an ""imbalance"" score here as we did for other insights. That's because we don't have enough information about the email senders to determine whether they're coordinating with you - remember, we develop your ""baseline"" communication style score by looking at all your sent emails. But we don't have all the sender's sent emails, and without the baseline, we can't tell if they're coordinating with you."
